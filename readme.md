# Computer Vision Project - recognize gender from face pictures

### About

In this project I used image analysis of many people face pictures. The purpose of the project was to build a model, which recognizes a gender of a person on a photo. The dataset has been split to three parts - test, train and valid set. I have also checked the model with pictures provided for myself.
